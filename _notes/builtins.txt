• Your shell must implement the following builtins:

◦ echo with option -n
◦ cd with only a relative or absolute path ◦ pwd with no options
◦ export with no options // not printing 
◦ unset with no options
◦ env with no options or arguments
◦ exit with no options

echo will collect all of the arg and print them out exsept flags "flag -n"
removes the new line , any other flags will be as a string for echo
