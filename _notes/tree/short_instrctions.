[1]   && or || as the head:
These operators control flow; && runs the next command if the previous one succeeds, while || runs the next command if the previous one fails.

[2]   Two && or || operators:
Multiple && or || create a sequence, controlling the flow between commands based on success or failure.

[3]   Pipe (|) connects commands:
A pipe connects the output of one command to the input of the next.

[4]   Arguments as command parameters:
Arguments are children of commands, defining their input or action.

[5]   Operators can nest:
Operators can form nested structures, controlling the flow of execution.

[6]   && followed by ||:
First && checks success; if it passes, || checks failure to decide the next command.

[7]   Pipe connects two commands:
The output of the first command goes to the input of the second command.

[8]   Operators between commands:
Operators act as parents, with commands as children, controlling execution order.

[9]   Chained commands with &&:
&& runs the next command only if the first one succeeds.

[10]   Chained commands with ||:
|| runs the next command only if the first one fails.
