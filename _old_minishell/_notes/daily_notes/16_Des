Notes
The wildcard functionality is almost complete, but it needs to be refined. There is something strange happening with capital letters.

Fix the segmentation fault that occurs when there is an error.

Expansion of the $_

in the <Redirection_Operators> function 
    if (cursor->next->next && index == 0)
        cursor->next->next->type = COMMAND;
this fix is not enough
